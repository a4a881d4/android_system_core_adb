ADBX - An extended version of adb.

Added Shortcut versions adb commands and adb shell commands

The majority of code changes are in commandline.c and adb_extended.c

Full Help:
adb help all = prints full information

Better Multiple Device Support 
interactive device selection if more than one device connect, devices can be selected by 
index number using -i switch

Shorthand Versions of shell commands:
adb sh = adb shell
adb dmesg = adb shell dmesg
adb getprop = adb shell getprop
adb svc-start = adb shell start
adb svc-stop = adb shell stop
... plus many more

Send Keyevents:
You can send all keycodes by name to the device - this is a shortcut to
adb shell input keyevent <key_code> 
see input_keyevent_codes.c for full list. many of the key_codes have shortcut e.g
adb menu = adb input keyevent 82
adb home = adb input keyevent 3
adb KEYCODE_MUSIC = adb input keyevent 209

Start Activities:
Currently only the settings activity can be started.
adb settings = adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -n com.android.settings/.Settings

Long Push Status Info:
prints progress information when doing adb push on a large file will now 

Building

The easiest way to build this is from the aosp source tree.
copy directory in the aosp root and run the following commands

. build/envsetup.sh
cd adbx

adb sync notes: adb sync [ <directory> ]
  <localdir> can be interpreted in several ways:

  - If <directory> is not specified, both /system and /data partitions will be updated.

  - If it is "system" or "data", only the corresponding partition
    is updated.

input commands:
  - You can send keyevents by name to a connected device simply by running
       adb <keycode_name>
  - This is the equivalent of adb shell input keyevent <keyevent code>
    All keyevents begin with the KEYCODE prefix. Some select keyevents have
    short versions, for a full list enter
       adb help keycodes
