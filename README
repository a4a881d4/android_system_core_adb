adb extended version 

For Help Details see first_attempt branch. 

Notes: 
I've restructed how the extensions hook , this is to minimize
the changes made to existing code and allow updated versions to be 
easily integrated.

General Architecture:
the adb entended version. adds many shortcuts to commands. this is done 
by "pre-processing" the command line to convert shortcut commands into 
the true shell commands. 

This minimizes the need to make major code chanages to existing code 
files. This is helpful to enable fast intgeration with the latest sources.

TODO:  




Patching into new versions:

adb.c - change the main function to add command line pre-processing 

	replace the call to adb_commandline(new_argc, new_argv);
	with a call to the extended version adb_commandline(new_argc, new_argv);
	we will handle it from there

adb.h - add definition for the extended_commandline function
	adb_extended_commandline(int argc, char** argv);

It really should('nt) be this simple.
